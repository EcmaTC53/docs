 ECMAScript Embedded Systems API Specification defines APIs for use on embedded systems. Embedded systems are far more diverse than personal computers, smartphones, and web servers where ECMAScript is most widely used.
 It is not enough for these APIs to support the features embedded systems have in common. To be truly useful, they must allow access to the unique hardware capabilities of each embedded system.

 This Standard is influenced by the Extensible Web Manifesto. It aims to provide low-level APIs that do things — primarily related to hardware and communication — that the ECMAScript language cannot do by itself. These low-level APIs are functional, simple, and efficient. The APIs may be used directly. However, it is expected that many developers will interact with them indirectly through higher-level modules and frameworks that build upon the low-level APIs. This layered approach keeps the low-level APIs small and focused while allowing a variety of uses and API styles to be built upon them.
